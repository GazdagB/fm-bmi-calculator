            Better understand your weight in relation to your height using our

            of a healthy weight, it offers a valuable starting point to evaluate
            your overall health and well-being.

          <p class="u-body-m">
            A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a
            healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on,
            such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced
            fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally,
            strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for
            five days a week.

              Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for
              every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in
              certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.
